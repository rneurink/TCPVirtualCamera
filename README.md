# TCPVirtualCamera

## Summary
A directshow virtual camera filter with a TCP socket to stream images to

Code is originally from [Vivek](https://groups.google.com/g/microsoft.public.win32.programmer.directx.video/c/1beZkSCb0KE/m/5VF366wR3CcJ) which was relocated to the github repo from [roman380](https://github.com/roman380/tmhare.mvps.org-vcam)

The code has been adapted in a way that is will host a TCP/IP Socket to which an application can send images to to display. This makes it possible to write an elaborate program in Python, Ruby, C#, C++ or whatever language supports TCP/IP sockets. This makes it really easy to use OpenCV in the client application and send the edited images to the virtual camera filter.
